# ESN-GRL-based-Generative-Adversarial-Imitation-Learning
This repository implements a two-stage imitation learning framework. First, a graph-based reinforcement learning (GRL) agent is trained as an expert policy. Then, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) uses the expertâ€™s demonstrations to train a new policy that imitates the expert without requiring an explicit reward function.
